Problem Statement: The data has monthly average gold prices in USD per troy ounce, since 1950 to April 2020. We want to make forecast for the prices in the coming year and decade.

Motivation: Gold once again has emerged as one of the best performing asset class in 2020 after stupendous 2019. Gold prices got shot in
the arm after US Federal Reserve chief warned that a full recovery of the US economy could drag through 2021 because of the ongoing pandemic. The increasing tension between the US and China have light the fuel for gold. Last week, gold was going nowhere as spot prices were trading in narrow range of $1690-$1710.

The fundamental story for gold remains strong as money printing by central banks and vast state stimulus packages are rekindling interest
in one of the oldest stores of wealth a.k.a gold. The same story was unfolding in 2008 when money managers piled in gold as an increase 
in money supply leads to a devaluation of currency and increase in inflation. But in 2008, inflation was kept checked which is why
gold had to scale back from highâ€™s of $1970 but the unprecedented scale of the government response to the coronavirus crisis is feeding 
the argument that this time it will be different. In an environment where bond yields are close to zero, real interest rates are 
consistently under zero, there is no opportunity cost of holding gold. Historically, that is when gold has performed the best. This has 
motivated me to build a forecasting model to see how gold performs in the future.
